# Animated-Map
We were set a task to create our own animated map in our MIT course for Week 9.

What I did was use a map of Sydney provided by mapbox and what I did with it was, show the stops a train makes when departing from Central station and arriving at Cronulla station. Every 5000 ms, the marker will move down the train line. It's easy to follow and the map is zoomed out enough that you can easily follow it. 

This is for now just a basic and fun little task I had to do for my course, but as I become more experienced with working with API's, I will eventually expand on this and turn it into a live tracker, as I lack the knowledge to be able to do that at this current time. 

It's simple to use, just like google maps, you can zoom in and out with your middle mouse button and look at the stops and you move across the map with left click and dragging.
To start the moving of the marker, just click the button in the top left, you won't be able to miss it.

To run the program, all you have to do is download all 3 files and drag the html file into your browser which will then load the program and you can use it.
